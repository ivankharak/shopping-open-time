# [Shopping Time](https://shopping-time.vercel.app/)
Shopping Time is an e-commerce website that has at least 150 women's clothing products with different sizes and color choices. You can choose various attributes like size and color. There is a cart where you can see added items and edit, add, or remove them. You can also set a currency of your choice.

## Functionality
- Ability to add/remove products and change the amount in the cart and cart overlay.
- Visible selected size and other attributes in the cart and cart overlay.
- Filtering products by categories.
- Ability to add products from the category page, as well as separate product page.
- Unable to add proucts until you select the size or colors.
- You can change the store currency to many options like EUR or GBP.
